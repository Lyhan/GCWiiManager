# GCWiiManager

The purpose of this project is help manage the export of Gamecube ISO backups. There are plenty of Wii backup managers out there but i was very frustrated not to find any that can manage Gamecube backups the way i wanted therefore I started this project.

So far it supports WBFS Wii backups and ISO Gamecube backups. It is possible that it also works with other formats but I have not tested it.

The code has been written using Python 3.5.1
